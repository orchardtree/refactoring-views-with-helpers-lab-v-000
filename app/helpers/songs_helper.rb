module SongsHelper
  #Write a helper method #display_artist in the appropriate app/helpers file to be called on in our views. The method's return value should take into consideration whether an artist is already associated with a song:
  #If an artist is already associated with the song, return a link to the artist's show page
  #If an artist is not associated with the song (a.k.a. 'else'), return a link to the song's edit page, with a link text of "Add Artist"
